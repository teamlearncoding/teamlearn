# TeamLearn
 
 ## What is TeamLearn

 TeamLearn is a "company"/website trying to help people from anywhere in the world learn how to code. It doesn't matter what's your race, religion, age. All that matters
is that if you want to learn coding, we got you covered.

 ## Installation guide
   First make sure you have npm and git installed. Then run the following commands
      git clone https://github.com/teamlearncoding/teamlearn.git
      npm run dev

   or

      npm run start

 ## How to read the codebase
  Recently we've added an express backend so now it makes the code a little bit harder to read but still pretty simple. In the public directory there are all the
files that the website needs to function. Right outside of that is the app.js file(there's where the express code is). 

 ## How to contribute
  If you want to contribute with a lesson you can either code that lesson yourself(in that case you have to sign the course) or give the materials to the Founder and he will take care of it. But if you just want to fix a bug, you can create an issue and tell us what the problem is.

 ## Technologies used
  -Express
  -Vanila JavaScript
  -Html
  -Css

 ## Final note
   And now for the final note, please don't forget why you started coding, you started coding because you wanted to build something that helps people in the real world. Don't forget that. Thank you -Arin
