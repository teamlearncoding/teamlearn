 ## What is TeamLearn

 TeamLearn is a "company"/website trying to help people from anywhere in the world learn how to code. It doesn't matter what's your race, religion, age. All that matters
is that if you want to learn coding, we got you covered.


 ## How to read the codebase
   Right now the codebase is pretty simple, we only got css, html and js folder which are pretty self explanatory. But in the future we would want to improve our customers experience as much as possible.

 ## Technologies used
   For now it's just plain javascript html and css.


 ## Final note
   And now for the final note, please don't forget why you started coding, you started coding because you wanted to build something that helps people in the real world. Don't forget that. Thank you -Arin
